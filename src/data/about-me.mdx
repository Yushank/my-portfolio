Hello! I’m **Yushank Kashyap**, a developer who enjoys building things on the web. My journey into software hasn’t been the straightest path—I actually started out in school experimenting with video editing while making fun YouTube videos with friends. That creative spark led me to explore motion graphics, animation, game development, and even freelancing in editing during my college years.

Although I pursued a **B.Tech in Computer Science**, I wasn’t always certain about becoming a software developer. But toward the end of college, while experimenting with simple HTML and CSS projects, I discovered how much I enjoyed creating for the web. That curiosity quickly turned into a passion, and over the past year I’ve been steadily learning, experimenting, and building **full-stack web applications**.

Now, I’m diving deeper into web development—not just as a career path, but because I genuinely enjoy the process of learning and building. For me, creating web apps feels like the perfect mix of problem-solving and creativity, and I’m excited to keep exploring where this journey takes me.
